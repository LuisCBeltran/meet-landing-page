## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass
- Pug

### What I learned

- Use of mixins and variables in a responsive design.
- Consolidation and practice of current CSS/Sass and HTML knowledge. 

### Continued development

This was a real challenge for current skills. Nevertheless, I need to practice more because I am currently too slow coding. With more practice I will consolidate the knowledge that I have built. I think it is time begin more in depth studies in JavaScript. 

### Useful resources
